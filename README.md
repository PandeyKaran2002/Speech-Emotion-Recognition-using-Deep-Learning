# **Speech-Emotion-Recognition-using-Spectrograms**
Deep Learning project to classify emotions from audio spectrograms using a custom CNN model.

## Project Highlights
- CNN-based classification on 8 emotion classes.
- Custom Spectrogram Augmentation (Brightness, Contrast, Time Masking, Frequency Masking).
- Class balancing with dynamic class weights.
- Regularization: Label Smoothing, Dropout Layers.
- Learning Rate Scheduling: ReduceLROnPlateau for smart training.
- Best Model Saving automatically.
- Advanced Evaluation: Normalized Confusion Matrix, Per-class Accuracies, and Accuracy Plots.
- All plots auto-saved neatly inside the /plots folder.

## Dataset:
Images generated from speech audio using spectrograms.<br>
<br>**Image Size:** 128x128<br>
**Color:** RGB.<br>
### 8 Emotions:<br>
- Angry
- Calm
- Disgust
- Fearful
- Happy
- Neutral
- Sad
- Surprised<br> 
<br>**Note: Dataset is not uploaded here due to size limitations.**

## Observations
- Validation accuracy has significantly improved after using spectrogram augmentation.

- Minority classes like Happy and Sad still need better separation but improved somewhat after targeted augmentation.

- Training accuracy dropped slightly (regularization effect), but generalization is better.

- Validation accuracy even surpassed training accuracy during some epochs â€” a good sign against overfitting.
